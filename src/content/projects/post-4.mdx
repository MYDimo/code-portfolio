[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/730bdb01-d7e1-4f64-a8a8-e713fd0ea221/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/chronophylax/deploys) This is a simple SPA to help me keeping track of time while working out at home.

## Techstack:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react,netlify,firebase,figma&theme=dark)](https://skillicons.dev)

## New things learned

- [clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - super useful for responsive typography ~94% usability
- how to setup and deploy on Netlify
- how to use [requestAnimationFrame()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) method
- how important is to have a design created upfront with already pre-defined typography and color
- useEffect unmount callback

## To change/do better next time

- use smaller timeframe to write core functionality
- keep up with KISS and DRY principles
- refactor code to a more elegant and pleasing which goes for both **JS** and **CSS
